# 🎭 NVIDIA AI-Powered Real-Time Emotion Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This is an **open-source AI-powered real-time emotion detection system** optimized using **NVIDIA TensorRT** for fast inference. It leverages **OpenCV** for face detection, a **pre-trained emotion recognition model**, and a **Flask/FastAPI backend** to serve predictions. The frontend is built with **React** for an interactive user experience.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **Real-time emotion recognition** using a deep learning model  
- ✅ **Optimized inference with NVIDIA TensorRT**  
- ✅ **Face detection with OpenCV**  
- ✅ **Fast and scalable API** using Flask/FastAPI  
- ✅ **User-friendly web interface** built with React  
- ✅ **Open-source and customizable**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
### **Backend**  
- Flask / FastAPI (for API)  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (for model)  
- OpenCV (for face detection)  
- NVIDIA TensorRT (for optimization)  

### **Frontend**  
- React  
- TailwindCSS  

### **Deployment (Optional)**  
- Docker  
- NVIDIA GPU for acceleration
