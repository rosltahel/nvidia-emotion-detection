![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b51dadc8-0d8c-4246-ab84-978c70e9b152)



## 📌 Overview  
This is an open-source AI-powered real-time emotion detection system optimized using **NVIDIA TensorRT** for fast inference. It leverages OpenCV for face detection, a pre-trained emotion recognition model, and a Flask/FastAPI backend to serve predictions. The frontend is built with React for an interactive user experience.

Emotion Detection Model:
The emotion recognition model uses a pre-trained deep learning architecture (e.g., CNN or similar) to classify human emotions based on facial expressions. It is optimized for performance using NVIDIA TensorRT, ensuring real-time processing for web applications.
## 🚀 Features
